[User Manual](DFR22_guide_en-US.pdf)

This is a DSP platform ([website](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/mixers/dfr22?variant=DFR22)) that we use to run audio processing on the Mains signal. It is configured as the pre-EQ insert on the main LR as an offboard insert (send on Allen & Heath AR84 output channel 3 & 4, insert return on board input 43 & 44).

The primary purpose of this is feedback reduction (hence the name, DFR = Digital Feedback Reduction), but it also can have more processing configured, and I'm not sure what the full configuration is. The software is compatible with Windows 98, NT, ME, 2000 Professional, or XP. According to an article on their website it's also compatible with Windows 7 and 8.
