This is a managed gigabit 5-port ethernet switch. It allows expanding the Dante network connection (previously only a point-to-point network connecting the [[notes/Allen & Heath GLD-112]] via its [[M-Dante Option Card]] to the [[Aviom D800 Pro 16e]]). This allows the addition of more devices, such as a computer with Dante Virtual Sound Card, to the Dante network. Using the Dante Controller application, audio streams can be routed to any device on the Dante network.
