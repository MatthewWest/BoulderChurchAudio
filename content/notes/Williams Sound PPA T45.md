[User Manual](ppa_t45.pdf)

A small radio transmitter for assistive hearing. We don't use this at all, but it appears to be connected properly and we should be able to use it if we have need for it.

# I/O
- XLR Input
	- [[notes/Allen & Heath AR84]]
- Power input
	- Horizontal power strip behind the board. #TODO is that driven off the Furman stager?
