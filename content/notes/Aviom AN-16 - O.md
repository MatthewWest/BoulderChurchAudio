- Used for Aviom IEMs.

The DB25 to XLR snake cable from this to the [[notes/Shure PSM900 Transmitter P9T|Shure PSM900 Transmitter P9T]] for IEM headset 3 is faulty. We need to replace that cable, one option would be [this one](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/DTM803--hosa-dtm-803-3-meter).

As of testing conducted by Matt West & Bryan Rothrock on 2023-07-19, channel 3 of this output isn't working. We have not yet determined whether the issue is with the internal DAC on that channel, or with the cable (channels 5 and 6 on the DB25 snake cable). The test that needs to be performed is to try using swapping the cable with the other DB25 to XLR snake and see whether that results in signal.
