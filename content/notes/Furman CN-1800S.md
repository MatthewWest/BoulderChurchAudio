[User Manual](Church_Audio/manuals/pdf_CN-1800S_manual.pdf)

Power conditioner & sequencer. We have one of these at the front-of-house audio console, and one in the primary back-of-house rack. This has been not working, according so we have been using the [[Furman P-8 Pro Series II]]

The connections of each unit include an input A/C plug into the wall socket, and 2 A/C plugs each for unswitched, phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 power. There's also a "smartsequencing" input
